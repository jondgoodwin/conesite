    <div class="text">

	<p>Use <span class="pre">while</span> to repetitively perform the same logic over and over again
		so long as a specified condition is true. For example:</p>
<pre>
fn fact(mut n i32) i32:
  mut result = 1
  while n &gt; 1:
    result *= n
    --n
  result
</pre>
  <p>This function calculates the factorial of some number n.
		So long as n stays greater than one, the inner block repeatedly multiplies result by n and then decrements n.
		So, if n is 5, result will be calculated as 5 * 4 * 3 * 2, returning 120.
	</p>
	<p>The while statement's condition can be any conditional expression, as described for <span class="pre">if</span>.
	  The condition is checked when encountering the while statement, and then again every time after
		the block's statements have been performed.
		Whenever the condition evaluates as false, execution continues at the first statement after the while block.</p>
	<p>The while statement's condition may be omitted, if there should not be an exit condition at the start of the loop.
		Within the while block must be found at least one break statement (see below) that will terminate the loop.
		A loop with no condition and no breaks would otherwise repeat forever.</p>

	<h3 id="break">break</h3>
	<p><span class="pre">break</span> statements may be placed anywhere within a while block
		to terminate the repetitive loop early.
		We can code the factorial function yet another way using 'break':</p>
<pre>
fn fact(mut n i32) i32:
  mut result = 1
  while true:
	  if n &lt; 2: break 
    result *= n--
  result
</pre>
	<p>As this example shows,
	<span class="pre">break</span> is typically found within an <span class="pre">if</span> block.
	A <span class="pre">break</span> statement terminates the control flow for the innermost
	loop block it is found within.</p>

	<h3 id="continue">continue</h3>
	<p>The <span class="pre">continue</span> statement also changes the loop's control flow.
		Instead of terminating the loop, it resumes execution at the top of the loop,
		re-evaluating the conditional expression.
		Effectively, <span class="pre">continue</span> ignores all subsequent statements in the loop's block.</p>
<pre>
fn countOdd(mut n i32) i32:
  mut result = 0
  while n &gt; 0:
    if n-- % 2 == 0: continue 
    ++result
  result
</pre>

	<h3>loop as expression</h3>
	<p>A <span class="pre">while</span> loop may be used within an expression, where it is expected to return a value.
		The value(s) returned by a <span class="pre">while</span> loop are specified by the loop's 
		<span class="pre">break</span> statements.
		The <span class="pre">while</span> statement cannot specify a conditional expression, as this condition
		does not specify the loop's returned value.</p>
	<p>This example shows use of a <span class="pre">while</span> loop as an expression.
		Notice the lack of conditional expression on the <span class="pre">while</span>
		and the specification of values on the <span class="pre">break</span> statements.</p>
<pre>
imm found = loop:
  if idx > maxidx: break -1 
  if matches(idx): break idx
  ++idx
</pre>
	<p>If this feature is used, all <span class="pre">break</span> statements in the loop
		must return a value, all of the same type.</p>

	<h3>Outer block breaks</h2>
	<p>To make it possible for <span class="pre">break</span> or <span class="pre">continue</span>
		to apply to a loop outside the loop it is in, mark the outer loop with a
		<a href="reftoken.html#lifetime">lifetime annotation</a> and then use that same
		annotation on the <span class="pre">break</span> or <span class="pre">continue</span> statement.</p>
<pre>
'outer: each n in 1...5:
	while obj.fireAShot():
		if obj.impacted: continue 'outer
</pre>
