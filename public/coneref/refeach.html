	<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Note: Only numeric range iterators with &lt;, &le;, &gt;, &ge; and by have been
			implemented.</i></p>

	<p><span class="pre">each</span> makes it easier than <span class="pre">while</span>
		to iterate over a sequence of values.
		For example, here's the factorial function using <span class="pre">each</span>:</p>
<pre>
fn fact(n i32) i32:
  mut result = 1
  each x in 2 ... n:
    result *= x
  result
</pre>
	<p>Effectively this <span class="pre">each</span> statement binds the variable x to each iterated value
		from 2 up to n inclusively, each time performing the loop's inner block.</p>
		<p>As this example shows, the <span class="pre">each</span> statement has a simple structure:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>One or more variables to be bound to values produced by the iterator.
				These variables are local to the <span class="pre">each</span> block and cannot be accessed outside that scope.</li>
			<li>An iterator that produces different value(s) on each iteration of the loop.
				The iterator follows <span class="pre">in</span>.</li>
			<li>A block containing the logic to be performed on each iteration.</li>
		</ul>
	
	<h2>break and continue</h2>
	<p><span class="pre">break</span> and <span class="pre">continue</span> statements may be used within an 
		<span class="pre">each</span> block to stop or re-start the loop.</p>

	<h2>Iterators</h2>
	<p><span class="pre">each</span> supports several ways to iterate over a sequence of values:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Number range</b>, for simple arithmetic progressions.</li>
		<li><b>Collection</b>, to work with individual elements within a collection.</li>
		<li><b>Closure</b>, to deal with algorithmically-generated values.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Number Range Iterator</h3>
	<p>As the above example shows, the <span class="pre">...</span> or <span class="pre">..</span>
		range operator can be used to iterate successively over integers or floating point numbers.
		Iteration begins with the first number and then increments by 1 until it
		reaches (..) or passes (...) the second number.
		Expressions may be used in place of literal numbers, if desired.</p>
	<p>To iterate <b>backwards</b> (decrementing the iterated number), use the
			<span class="pre">&gt;</span> or <span class="pre">&gt;=</span> operators instead.</p>
<pre>
each x in 6 &gt; 1  // iterates:  6 5 4 3 2
</pre>
	</p>
	<p>A <b>step value</b> may be specified after <span class="pre">by</span>.
		Instead of incrementing or decrementing by 1, the step value specifies how much to increase the iterated number each time:</p>
<pre>
mut sum = 0
each x in 0 ... 10 by 2: // iterates: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
  sum += x	
</pre>

	<h3 id="array">Collection Iterator</h3>
	<p><span class="pre">each</span> can be used to iterate through 
		every element in a collection,	one at a time. For example:</p>
<pre>
mut sum = 0
each x in [4, 3, 8, 2]:
  sum += x
</pre>
	<p>Iteration can also capture the index or key for each element value:</p>
<pre>
each i, x in intslice:
  newslice[i] = x
</pre>
	
	<h3>Closure Iterator</h3>
	<p>Look to closures for iterator versatility.
			Using closure iterators, one can scan through elements in a complex collection,
			retrieve values from a streaming resource, algorithmically calculate a sequence of values, etc.
		Because closures are stateful, they can generate a new value on every call.</p>
	<p>In order for a closure to be suitable as an iterator, it must be able to signal when it is done producing values.
		 It typically does this by returning an <a href="refoption.html">optional value</a>,
		 with the value of <span class="pre">None</span> signalling when it is done.</p>
	<p>In the following example, imagine a closure that starts off
	holding the value 12, and halves (and returns) its value on each call. When the value gets to 0,
	it returns <span class="pre">None</span> instead:</p>
<pre>
mut sum = 0
each x in |{cnt = 12}| if cnt > 0 {Some[cnt /= 2]} else {None}:
  sum += x
</pre>
		<p>The value of sum at the end will be 10, as each successive call to the closure returns 6, 3, and 1.
			After 1, it returns <span class="pre">None</span>, which stops iteration.</p>
		<p>Because it is stateful, a closure is typically single use. It is created before it is needed, used to produce values lazily, 
			and then discarded afterward. 
			This is because, unless its state can be independently reset, it will only ever afterward say it is out of values.</p>
		
		<h4>Automatic Closure Creation</h4>
		<p>Not uncommonly, we simply want to specify some resource,
			and have <span class="pre">each</span>
			automatically create a closure for iterating over the collection.
			For this reason, when a value is specified on <span class="pre">each</span> 
			that is not already an iterator,
			a call to the <span class="pre">iter</span> method is implicitly made.
			<span class="pre">iter</span> is expected to return a closure iterator:</p>
<pre>
each x in collection  // equivalent to: each x in collection.iter
</pre>
		<p>Similarly, if an iterator is expected to return two values,
			the <span class="pre">kviter</span> method is implicitly invoked instead:</p>
<pre>
each key, value in dictionary
</pre>
