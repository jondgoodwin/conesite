    <div class="text">

	<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Note: Most of this has been implemented,
		other than the &amp;- operator, closures, and init/drop methods.</i></p>

	<p>Many operators are implemented as method calls. For instance, <span class="pre">x+3</span>
		is treated as if it were:  <span class="pre">x.`+`(3)</span>
		A type need only implement the <span class="pre">`+`</span> method to
		make the <span class="pre">+</span> operator meaningful to values of that type.
		If a program tries to apply the <span class="pre">+</span> operator to a value 
		whose type has not implemented the <span class="pre">`+`</span> method,
		a compiler error results.</p>
	<p>Let's explore the implications across a number of operators.</p>

	<h2>Value Operator Methods</h2>
	<p>A type may support any of the <a href="refexpr.html#arith">arithmetic operators</a>
		(<span class="pre">+</span>, <span class="pre">-</span>, <span class="pre">*</span>,
		<span class="pre">/</span> and <span class="pre">%</span>) 
		by implementing them as methods.
		The integer and floating point types do this, of course,
		but really any type that effectively encodes numbers or number structures can do this.
		This might include: complex numbers, "big" integers, rationals, unit-based numbers, vectors or matrices.</p>
		<p>On the previous page, the <span class="pre">Point</span> type example
		took advantage of this by implementing the subtraction method:</p>
<pre>
fn `-`(pt2) Point:
	Point[pt2.x - x, pt2.y - y]
</pre>
	<p><b>Note:</b> Whenever a name includes non-alphanumeric (or underscore) characters,
		it must be enclosed in backticks. This is why the method name is shown as
		<span class="pre">`-`</span>.</p>
	<p>With this method implemented, one may simply subtract two Points in an expression:
		<span class="pre">pt1 - pt2</span>.</p>
	<p>Unary negation may also be implemented using the <span class="pre">`-`</span>.
		The difference between the negation method and the subtraction method is that
		the former needs only the self parameter:</p>
<pre>
fn `-`() Point:
  Point[-x, -y]
</pre>
	
	<h4>Logic and Shift Operator Methods</h4>
	<p>Similarly, a type may support any of the <a href="refexpr.html#bitwise">logic and shift operators</a>
		(<span class="pre">!</span>, <span class="pre">&</span>, <span class="pre">^</span>,
		<span class="pre">~</span>, <span class="pre">&lt;&lt;</span> and <span class="pre">&gt;&gt;</span>) 
		by implementing them as methods.</p>
		
	<h4 id="compare">Comparison Operator Methods</h4>
	<p>To support operator-based comparison of two values, implement the appropriate
		<a href="refif.html#compare">comparison operator(s)</a>
		(<span class="pre">==</span>, <span class="pre">&lt;</span>, <span class="pre">&lt;=</span>,
		<span class="pre">&gt;</span>, or <span class="pre">&gt;=</span>) 
		as methods.
		It is not necessary to implement the inequivalence operator (<span class="pre">!=</span>),
		as this is supported automatically if <span class="pre">`==`</span> is implemented.
	</p>

	<h4>isTrue "truthy" Method</h4>
	<p>Conditional expressions depend on a boolean value of true or false.
		If a conditional expression returns a value of some type other than Bool,
		Cone will check whether the type implements the <span class="pre">isTrue</span> method.
		If so, it will use that method to convert a conditional expression's to true or false.</p>
	<p>In effect, this is how Cone supports the notion of type-specific "truthy" values. For example:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Integer values are false if 0, true otherwise.</li>
	<li>Floating point values are false if 0 or -0, true otherwise.</li>
	<li>Pointers are false if null, true otherwise.</li>
	<li>Option values are false if None, and true if Some.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Value Mutation Methods</h2>
	<p>Several operator methods may be implemented that change an existing mutable value in memory.
		When the value is held by some variable, the compiler effectively obtains a mutable reference to the variable,
		and calls the method using the mutable reference.
	<p>This can be illustrated with a simple example. Let's say that a type wants to override the simple assignment
		operator with a method that performs a deep (rather than the default shallow) copy of the value.
		The signature of the method will accept a mutable reference to the target:
<pre>
fn `=`(self &amp;mut, value) Self:
</pre>
	<p>When assignment is performed for a value of this type (<span class="pre">a = b</span>),
		it will obtain a mutable borrowed reference to the lval 'a' and then
		call the method like this:  <span class="pre">&amp;uni a.`=`(b)</span>.
	
	<h4>Arithmetic, Logic, Bitwise Assignment Operators</h4>
	<p>A custom type may also support any of the <a href="refexpr.html#arithassign">arithmetic assignment operators</a>
		(<span class="pre">+=</span>, <span class="pre">-=</span>, <span class="pre">*=</span>,
		<span class="pre">/=</span> and <span class="pre">%=</span>) 
		by implementing them as methods.</p>
	<p>If a type does not implement the arithmetic assignment operators,
		the compiler will attempt to implement them using the arithmetic methods.
		Thus, <span class="pre">pt1 += pt2</span> would be treated as if it were:
		<span class="pre">pt1 = pt1 + pt2</span>.</p>
	<p>Similarly, the logic and shift assignment operators may also be implemented as methods.
		If not, they will be handled in the same way as the arithmetic assignment operators.</p>
	
	<h4>Increment and Decrement Operators</h4>
	<p>A type may implement the <a href="refexpr.html#incrdecr">increment or decrement operators</a>
			(<span class="pre">++</span> and <span class="pre">--</span>) as methods.
			When used as prefix operators, their names are <span class="pre">`++`</span> and <span class="pre">`--`</span>.
			When used as postfix operators, their names are
			<span class="pre">`_++`</span> and <span class="pre">`_--`</span>.
	</p>

	<h2>Computed Properties</h2>
	<p>For public fields, there is often no reason to implement getters and setters to offer
		direct access to their values, because it is faster to access the fields directly.
		However, if it would be unsafe to offer direct access to certain fields,
		in order to preserve specific data invariants, one should make them private
		and then potentially offer appropriate getter and setter methods that preserve the invariants.</p>

 	<p>Implementing a getter and setter is easy:</p>
<pre>
struct Counter:
	_count u32 = 0

  // a getter
  fn counter() u32:
    _count

  // a setter (notice the use of a mutable reference, since the value will be changed)
  fn count(self &amp;mut, cnt u32):
    _count = cnt
</pre>
	<p>And here we use them:</p>
<pre>
mut x = Counter[]
x.counter // 0
x.counter = 10 // uses the "setter" to set the value
x.counter // 10
</pre>
	<p>Since we can omit the parentheses when using a getter or setter,
		their use looks just like access to a public field.
		This makes it possible to start off with a type that makes a field public,
		and then later changes it to private because of an invariant.
		By implementing getters and setters instead, the API can be preserved
		even as the implementation evolves.</p>

	<h2>Collection Operators</h2>
	<p>By wrapping an array (or array reference) within a struct, one can
		create all sorts of collections: indexed collections like vectors and dictionaries,
		as well as stacks, queues, sets and more.
		The difference between them is largely determined by which methods are implemented for
		working with various elements of the collection.
		Most collections will typically implement the
		<span class="pre">len</span> method to find how many elements are currently in the collection,
		and <span class="pre">iter</span> to enable iteration through the collection's elements.</p>
	<p>A couple of operators make it easier to work with collections:
		<span class="pre">[]</span> for indexed access and
		<span class="pre">&lt;-</span> to add or remove an element.
		Each collection type implements methods that determine how these operators work.</p>

	<h3>[] Indexed Access Operator</h3>
	<p>As we saw with arrays, the <span class="pre">[]</span> operator is used to
		access a specific collection element according to its index.
		Implementing the <span class="pre">[]</span> method as both a getter and setter
		makes indexed access possible for other kinds of indexed collections.
		The index need not even be an unsigned integer, as it is for an array.
		Dictionaries, for example, often use strings as the index.</p>

	<h3 id="append">&lt;- Append Operator</h3>
	<p>Some types may implement one or more overloaded methods for "&lt;-", to "append"
		values to a receiver. This can be useful for a variety of purposes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Appending elements to the end of some collection, queue or string.</li>
		<li>Serializing data to an output stream, such as the console.</li>
		<li>Sending data to another thread/actor/machine via a channel</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is not necessary that all values appended to the receiver be data
		that is accumulated by the receiver. Some values could be understood 
		to be instructional directives that alter the behavior of the receiver
		on the fly. For example, a directive could offer formatting, rendering or structuring instructions.	</p>
	<p>As a convenience, if a tuple appears after the append operator, this is transformed into multiple
		distinct append statements:</p>
<pre>
print &lt;- "Hello ", user   // equivalent to: print &lt;- "Hello "; print &lt;- user
</pre>
		
	<h2>() "Function call" Operator</h2>
	<p>It is actually possible to "call" an object as if it were a function.
		Doing so will actually invoke the <span class="pre">()</span> method
		for the object.

	<h3>Closures as anonymous structs</h3>
	<p>A closure is really just syntactic sugar for an anonymous struct
		that implements the <span class="pre">()</span> method.
		The closure <span class="pre">|n i32 {cnt = 0}| cnt += n</span>
		is roughly equivalent to:</p>
<pre>
struct Cntstr:
  _cnt = 0
  fn `()`(self &amp;mut, n i32):
    _cnt += n

mut counter = Cntstr[]
&amp;mut counter(1)        // 1
&amp;mut counter(2)        // 3
</pre>
	<p>As this example demonstrates, the closure itself is defined by the
		<span class="pre">Cntstr</span> struct.
		The closure's state is define by its field(s).
		The functional logic is captured within a single method named
		<span class="pre">()</span>.</p>
	<p>Any explicitly callable struct is effectively also a closure.</p>

	<h2>Initializers and Finalizers</h2>
	<p>A type may define one or more <b>initializers</b>.
		Initializers offer an alternative to the type constructor
		to create a new value of that type.
		In contrast to a type constructor, which uses square brackets, an initializer uses parentheses:</p>
<pre>
imm pt = Point(1.)
</pre>
	<p>The default name for initializers is <span class="pre">init</span>. 
		An initializer may, however, use some other name.
		In particuar, an initializer named <span class="pre">clone</span>
		is automatically used (when defined) whenever
		a copy of a value needs to be made due to assignment, function call parameters, etc.</p>
	<p>A type may also define a single <b>finalizer</b> called <span class="pre">final</span>.
		This is automatically invoked immediately before any value of that type is destroyed,
		and its memory space reclaimed.</p>
	<p>On a later page, detailed advice is given 
		on how to <a href="refinitdrop.html">define initializers and finalizers</a>.</p>
