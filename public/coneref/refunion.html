	<p>Unions are useful when we want a value to be represented by one of several variant struct types.
		For example, consider this union type:</p>
<pre>
union Point:
	struct XyPoint:
		x f32
		y f32
	struct AngPoint:
		dist f32
		angle f32
</pre>
	<p>This defines a new union type called <span class="pre">Point</span>
		which holds a single point value.
		At any given point in time, that value would either be an XyPoint or a AngPoint value.</p>
	<p>There are two interesting properties important to know about unions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>These are discriminated unions: there is a hidden "tag" field at the beginning of the value
			which is used at runtime to distinguish which of the variant types the value belongs to.
			This tag field would effectively hold a 0 for an XyPoint and 1 for a AngPoint.</li>
		<li>All variant structs in a union occupy the exact same size of memory.
			This size is the size of the largest struct plus the size of the tag field.
			Any smaller structs are padded to fit.</li>
		<li>All the variant types are considered part of the module namespace rather than part of the union namespace,
			which means they can be used directly without the need to qualify the name with the name of the union.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To create variant types who sizes vary, or whose number of variants is open-ended,
		use a <a href="reftrait.html">base trait</a> instead of a union.</p>
	
	<h3>Declaration</h3>
	<p>As the above example shows, the simplest form of a union type declaration is as easy as packaging
		several struct definitions inside an overall named union declaration block.
		It is permissible for any of these structs to be empty of fields, as the presence of the tag field
		ensures that the overall struct is not empty.</p>
	<p>Any number of fields may be specified prior to the first struct declaration. 
		All these fields are considered in common and at the beginning across all the variant structs.</p>
<pre>
union Event:
	time datetime
	struct ButtonEvent:
		button u8
		pushed Bool
	struct KeyEvent:
		key Unicode
	struct QuitEvent
</pre>
	<p>In this example, all three variant structs include the <span class="pre">time</span>
		field prior to any fields they have defined.</p>
	<p>For alignment reasons, it may be desirable to place the implicit tag field in some other spot
		other than the first field. To do this, specify an anonymous field of 
		<span class="pre">_ enum</span> wherever the tag field should be located.</p>

		<h3>Initialization</h3>
		<p>An union initial value is built using a constructor for one of the variant struct types:</p>
<pre>
mut event = QuitEvent[timestamp]
oddval = KeyEvent[timestamp, 's']
</pre>

		<h3>Copying</h3>
		<p>A union value may be passed around, by copy, just like any other value.
			This is possible because all variant values of a specific enum type are the same size.
			The enum type's size is effectively the size of its largest variant type
			plus the size of its hidden tag field.
		</p>

		<h3>Value Access</h3>
		<p>To safely gain access to the differently-typed value enclosed with an enum value,
			we must use <a href="refmatch.html">pattern matching</a> to determine which variant type
			it holds. Once that has been narrowed, it can be used like any other struct value.</p>

	<h3>Comparing</h3>
	<p>An enum value may only be compared for equivalence (and not order).
		The equivalence check compares the tag fields first.
		If they are equal, the appropriately-typed interior values are compared
		using the <span class="pre">==</span> method.</p>
