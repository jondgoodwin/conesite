	<p>A tuple is like a struct, as it holds multiple co-located values, each with its own type.
		Unlike a struct, neither the tuple itself, nor its elements, are named.
		Tuples match as equivalent if they have the same number of elements whose individual
		types match in the same order.</p>
	<p>Tuples are particularly valuable for returning multiple values (without having to
		use a pre-defined struct). For example:</p>
<pre>
fn getxy(point Point) f32, f32:
  point.x, point.y

fn main(point Point):
  imm x f32
  imm y f32
  x, y = getxy(point)
</pre>
	<p>The getxy function returns a tuple holding two floating-point values. Notice that the tuple type
		is defined by a comma-separated list of types. Similarly, the tuple value itself is
		composed using comma-separated values. (Note: )
		(Note: In some other contexts, such as a parameter or field tuple, it will be necessary to wrap comma-separated
		list of types or value within parentheses.)</p>
	<p>When getxy is called by main, the two returned values are separately stored into the x and y variables.
		Notice the types of the tuple's elements match those of the variables used to store its values.</p>
	
	<p>Another benefit lies with parallel assignment, where multiple values can be stored in different homes.
		For example, this example swaps the values of x and y.</p>
<pre>
  x, y = y, x
</pre>
	
	<h2>Accessing a single element of a tuple</h2>
	<p>Similar to structs, the dot operator can be used to access a specific element of a tuple.
		Since elements don't have names (like fields), use an integer constant to specify which element to
		extract (with '0' as the first element):</p>
<pre>
  y = getxy(point).1
</pre>
