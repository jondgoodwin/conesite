	<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Note: Most of this is implemented to some degree.</i></p>
	
	<p>Typing is strict: You cannot put a round peg in a square hole.</p>
	<p>Since all values, expressions and variables have a type, the compiler can (and will)
		check whether the use of types is consistent.
		In most cases, an error will be reported wherever a program:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Stores a value of one type into a variable or collection declared for a different type.</li>
		<li>Passes an argument of one type to a function that expects a value of another type in that position.</li>
		<li>Returns a value of one type when the function's signature declares a different type for the return value.</li>
		<li>Creates a reference (or pointer) to an object whose type does not match the reference's type declaration.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These constraints protect against a program manipulating a value in ways that make no sense or could be harmful,
		due to acting as if the value has a different meaning than it actually does.</p>
	<p>However, sometimes we <i>do</i> want to transform a value of one type to another type.
		Cone supports three such capabilities:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Coercion</b>,
			which implicitly and safely maps a subtype-based value to its semantic equivalent in a supertype.</li>
		<li><b>Conversion</b>,
			which explicitly constructs the closest "equivalent" value in another type.
			This mapping is imperfect, as some (or all) of the meaning of the original value could be lost.</li>
		<li><b>Reinterpretation</b>,
			which explicitly preserves the original value but re-interprets it as if it has a different type.
			This potentially unsafe capability will be described on another 
			<a href="reftrust.html#reinterpret">page</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To distinguish between coercion and conversion, 
		it is first necessary to understand how subtyping works in Cone.</p>

	<h2 id="subtype">Subtypes</h2>
	<p>Subtyping captures a simple but powerful idea: if we have two types named 
		<span class="pre">Base</span> and <span class="pre">Subtype</span>,
		how do we determine when it is safe to substitute in a value of
		type <span class="pre">Subtype</span> whenever our program logic
		is looking for a value of type <span class="pre">Base</span>?</p>
		<p>Here are two essential criteria (there are others):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Every possible value in <span class="pre">Subtype</span> can be mapped uniquely
				to its semantically identical value in <span class="pre">Base</span>.</li>
		<li>The behavior of values in <span class="pre">Subtype</span>
			must correspond in every way to the behavior of equivalent
			values in <span class="pre">Base</span>.
			In our case, that means at minimum that for every method in <span class="pre">Base</span>,
			there exists an equivalent method in <span class="pre">Subtype</span>
			with the same type signature and constraints.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Many type pairs in Cone comply with these criteria and support a safe subtyping relationship:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Any variant type is a subtype of any trait or struct type 
			that it complies with, even if it does not inherit from it.</li>
		<li>Any non-nullable type is a subtype of its
			nullable equivalent (e.g., <span class="pre">&Foo</span> 
			is a subtype of <span class="pre">?&Foo</span>).</li>
		<li>A borrowed reference is a subtype of an equivalently-typed owning reference
			(e.g., <span class="pre">&Foo</span> is a subtype of <span class="pre">&so Foo</span>)</li>
		<li>A <a href="refptr.html">pointer</a>
			is a subtype of any reference whose object type is the same.</li>
		<li>Some reference permissions are subtypes of others
			(e.g., <span class="pre">const</span> is a subtype of 
			<span class="pre">imm</span> or <span class="pre">mut</span>).
			Similarly, most permissions are a subtype of <span class="pre">uni</span>.</li>
		<li>A smaller number type is a subtype of a larger version of the same type
			(e.g., <span class="pre">u8</span> is a subtype of <span class="pre">u32</span>).</li>
		<li>A struct is a subtype of any trait it conforms to.
			More will be said about <a href="reftrait.html">traits</a> and subtyping later.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>An important characteristic of subtyping relationships is that
		it is trivially safe to transform a <span class="pre">Subtype</span> value
		into its equivalent <span class="pre">Base</span> value.
		However, the journey of a value back from <span class="pre">Base</span>
		to <span class="pre">Subtype</span> often requires some sort of
		pattern-matched guard, as there are likely to be values in <span class="pre">Base</span>
		that do not have a valid mapping from 
		<span class="pre">Subtype</span> to <span class="pre">Base</span>.
		A successful pattern match guarantees we will get back a valid
		<span class="pre">Subtype</span> value when the reverse transformation is applied.</p>
		
	<h2 id="coercion">Implicit Coercion</h2>
	<p>We call it coercion when transforming a subtype value into
		its equivalent base value.
		Coercion is the one safe exception to the strict typing rule described earlier,
		given that the type of a value and its receiver are not strictly the same.</p>
	<p>Since coercion is always safe, Cone performs it implicitly
		when copying or moving a subtype value
		to any container (variable, parameter, return value, field, reference)
		expecting a base value.
		This happens during assignments, function calls and returns.
		For example:</p>
<pre>
fn doStuff ()
  imm bigint u32 = 101u8        // Coerce a u8 to u32
  mut matrix = &so Mat4[]       // Allocate a matrix
  imm float = mat4det(matrix)?  // Coerce &so uni Mat4 to ?&Mat4

fn mat4det(mat &Mat4) f32 throws DivByZero
  // ...
  return 1.0                     // Coerce f32 to Result&lt;&gt;
</pre>
	<p>Coercion is more than just changing the type of some value.
		It usually means creating a new value whose encoding is different 
		than its source value.</p>
	<p>Coercion can also trigger compiler mechanics:
		In the case of coercing an owning reference to a borrowed reference,
		it triggers appropriate borrowing mechanics on the source variable.
		Similarly, when coercing a non-copy value, move semantics apply.</p>
	<p>If an expression requires, it is possible to explicit request coercion.
		For non-reference types, use the appropriate constructor
		(as described below for conversion).
		For references, use the <span class="pre">as</span> operator:</p>
<pre>
imm newref = oldref as &Point  // Explicitly coerce to a borrowed reference
</pre>

	<h3>Implicit Coercion of 'self'</h3>
		<p>Cone offers a very different form of coercion when dealing with method calls 
		(or field access) and the 'self' value. This convenience sugar
		automatically coerces self from a value to a reference (or the other way).</p>
	<p>Cone will automatically transform 'self' to a mutable borrowed reference
		for operators that expect an lval, such as <span class="pre">++</span>,
		<span class="pre">+=</span>, or a 'set' method.</p>
<pre>
++a    // equivalent to:  Type::`++`(&mut a)
</pre>
	<p>Automatic de-reference of 'self' may happen when 'self' is a reference,
		but no method matches with a reference-based self.
		'self' is then automatically dereferenced in hopes of finding a matching
		method that uses a value rather than a reference.</p>
<pre>
&a + 5  // may coerce to:  a + 5
</pre>

<h2>Explicit Conversion</h2>
	<p>Type conversion involves transforming a value of one type
		to the closest possible value in another type.
		For example, converting the integer 1 to the floating point number 1.0,
		or serializing it to text:  "1".
		Unlike coercion, conversion may not map perfectly: 
		A valid mapping may not exist or some precision may be lost.
	</p>
	<p>Conversion is typically requested using the new type's constructor
		or invoking one of its initializers</p>
<pre>
imm float = f32[1]
imm text = Text(1) // "1"
</pre>
	<p>In some cases, it may be more convenient to request conversion 
		by using some method in the old type:</p>
<pre>
imm text = 1.text
</pre>
