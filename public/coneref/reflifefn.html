	<p>To ensure borrowed references are always safe to use, they carry 
		a lifetime constraint that restricts them from living beyond the scope
		they were created in.
		This constraint prevents a borrowed reference from pointing to an
		object that no longer exists.
		Borrowed references may move freely around the program, so long as they never try to
		travel beyond this lifetime barrier.
		Attempts to violate this lifetime constraint result in a compiler error.</p>
	<p>For a borrowed reference used within the same function where it was borrowed,
		the compiler knows exactly which scope created the borrowed reference,
		and thus knows exactly what scope represents its lifetime barrier.
		However, a function that receives a borrowed reference from another function
		has no visibility into which scope created the borrowed reference.
		There is effectively a thick brick wall separating a called function
		from the function that calls it. 
		Each cannot see anything about what the other is doing with borrowed references.</p>

	<h2>Lifetime Annotations on Function Signatures</h2>
	<p>To bridge this knowledge gap, Cone looks for 
		<a href="reftoken.html#lifetime">lifetime annotations</a> on
		borrowed references in a function's signature.</p>
<pre>
fn dostuff(a: &'a i32, b: &'b i32) &'a i32, &'b i32
</pre>
	<p><span class="pre">'a</span> and <span class="pre">'b</span> are lifetime
		annotations representing two possibly-different lifetime scopes.
		Lifetime annotations are used to establish lifetime relationships between borrowed references.
		In this example, this means the first return value
		has the same lifetime as <span class="pre">a</span>, and the
		second has the same lifetime as <span class="pre">b</span>.</p>
	<p>Although the called function treats them as having the "same" lifetime,
		they might in fact have different lifetimes in the calling function.
		When references with two different lifetimes are treated as having the
		same lifetime, their understood lifetime would be the shortest one,
		as that is the only lifetime these references have in common.</p>
	<p>Lifetime annotations may be omitted on some or all borrowed
		references on a function signature.
		All borrowed references without annotations are
		understood to have the same lifetime, as if they had all been
		marked by the same lifetime annotation.
		The above example is thus identical to:</p>
<pre>
fn dostuff(a: &i32, b: &'b i32) &i32, &'b i32
</pre>
	<p>We can rule out the need for any lifetime annotations if the function does not
		receive at least two borrowed references in its parameters.
		We can also rule out them out if the borrowed references
		in parameters are all read-only (<span class="pre">const</span>)
		and no borrowed reference is returned.
		Beyond this simple test, there are two specific situations where
		lifetime annotations might be required.</p>

	<h3>Returned borrowed references</h3>
	<p>When a function returns a borrowed reference and accepts at least two borrowed references
		as parameters, lifetime annotations might be needed.
		Let's illustrate with a simple example:</p>
<pre>
fn caller(nbr i32) i32
  mut ref &amp;i32
  imm outer = 5
  {
    imm inner = 10
    ref = refswitch(nbr, &outer, &inner)
  }
  *ref // Is this safe???
</pre>
	<p>That final de-reference will not be safe if the called function looks like this:</p>
<pre>
fn refswitch(nbr i32, ref1 &i32, ref2 &i32) &i32
  if nbr &lt; 0
    ref1
  else
    ref2
</pre>
	<p>The problem is that <span class="pre">caller</span> has no idea whether
		<span class="pre">refswitch</span> will return a reference to 
		<span class="pre">inner</span> or <span class="pre">outer</span>.
		Since it could possibly be a reference to <span class="pre">inner</span>, 
		that final de-reference could be unsafe,
		as <span class="pre">inner</span> is gone by the time the de-reference happens.</p>
	<p>However, if we call a function that clearly indicates the returned reference
		only originates from ref1 
		(by marking <span class="pre">ref2</span> as having a different lifetime
		<span class="pre">'a</span>),
		then <span class="pre">caller</span>'s logic is safe:</p>
<pre>
fn refswitch(nbr i32, ref1 &i32, ref2 &'a i32) &i32
  ref1
</pre>
	<p>If the signature shows the returned reference originates
		from ref2, <span class="pre">caller</span> once again triggers a compiler error:</p>
<pre>
fn refswitch(nbr i32, ref1 &'a i32, ref2 &i32) &i32
  ref2
</pre>
	<p>The lesson here is pretty simple: If a function returns a borrowed reference,
		make sure its lifetime annotation matches the borrowed reference(s) it could be
		sourced from. Then make sure that any borrowed references that are not
		the source for it are marked with a different lifetime.
		When correctly marked in this way, lifetime constraints will be properly
		enforced on both the caller and called functions.</p>

	<h3>Mutable borrowed reference parameters</h3>
	<p>When a function passes at least two borrowed references as parameters,
		at least one being mutable, lifetime annotations might be needed.
		Consider:</p>
<pre>
fn tryit()
  imm i = 5
  mut a = &amp;i
  {
    imm b = 10
		refstore(&amp;mut a, &amp;b) // is this ok?
	}
</pre>
	<p>That's not going to work if it calls this function:</p>
<pre>
fn refstore(refmut &amp;mut &amp;i32, refval &amp;i32)
  *refmut = refval  // Oh my!
</pre>
	<p>What's the problem?
		<span class="pre">refstore</span> assumes that both borrowed references
		point to objects of the same (smallest) lifetime.
		<span class="pre">tryit</span> knows that smallest lifetime is the
		scope of <span class="pre">b</span>. However, it realizes that there is a
		risk that <span class="pre">refstore</span> might 
		store <span class="pre">refval</span> in <span class="pre">retmut</span> (as it does!),
		which would effectively lengthen the reference's lifetime to the scope of
		<span class="pre">a</span>, which is longer than the known lifetime
		of the object (<span class="pre">b</span>) it points to.
		Because of this risk, <span class="pre">tryit</span> will trigger a compile error
		on that call.</p>
	<p>There are two ways to make this error go away.
		The first involves move <span class="pre">b</span> to the same scope
		as <span class="pre">a</span>, making the lifetimes truly equivalent.
		The other approach is to make the <span class="pre">refstore</span>
		function promise it won't store one reference inside the other,
		by marking their lifetimes as independent:</p>
<pre>
fn refstore(refmut &amp;mut &amp;i32, refval &amp;'b i32)
  **refmut = *refval
</pre>
	<p>The lesson here is once again simple:
		If you pass a mutable borrowed reference, mark every other borrowed reference
		with a different lifetime annotation if you don't intend for it to be
		stored in the mutable borrowed reference.</p>

	<h2>Lifetime Annotations on Fields</h2>
	<p>It is not enough to just constrain the lifetimes of borrowed references,
		we must also constrain the lifetimes of any data structures that
		contain borrowed references as fields. Consider:</p>		
<pre>
struct Wrapper
  refa &'a u32
  refb &'b u32
</pre>
	<p>Every <span class="pre">Wrapper</span> value contains two fields, 
		both borrowed references, each with a different lifetime constraint.
		The lifetime of this value will be constrained by whichever ends up as the
		shorter of the two lifetimes:</p>
<pre>
fn process()
  imm val = 5
  makewrap(&val)

fn makewrap(valref &i32) Wrapper
  imm val = 10
  Wrapper[valref, &val]  // oops
</pre>
	<p>The <span class="pre">Wrapper</span> value is created
		in the <span class="pre">makewrap</span> function
		using a borrowed reference created in that function. 
		Therefore, this value is lifetime-constrained
		to this function and may not be returned to <span class="pre">process</span>.</p>

	<h3>Lifetime Annotations on Types</h3>
	<p>The same lifetime annotation principles we discussed earlier
		apply to functions that receive or return values
		which have borrowed references within them as fields.</p>
<pre>
fn process()
  imm val = 5
  makewrap(&val)
	
fn makewrap(valref &i32) &i32
  imm val = 10
  getref(Wrapper[valref, &val])
	
fn getref(wrap: Wrapper&lt;'a, 'b&gt;) &'a i32
  wrap.refa
</pre>
	<p><span class="pre">getref</span> shows
		how lifetime annotations are specified differently on aggregate types:
		inside angled brackets are two lifetimes, 
		one for each borrowed reference in the struct.
		Notice that the function returns the borrowed reference
		held by <span class="pre">refa</span> (the longer one),
		also signalled by the lifetime annotation on the return type.</p>
	<p>Were we to change <span class="pre">getref</span> to return
		<span class="pre">refb</span> instead, the <span class="pre">makewrap</span>
		function will be smacked with an error for trying to return
		a borrowed reference it created and which must not outlive its scope.</p>
