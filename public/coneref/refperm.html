	<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><i>Note: Although most of these permissions are supported,
			only mutability and coercion are enforced.</i></p>
	
	<p>Every reference's type specifies a permission which controls
		what may, and may not, be done with that reference.
		Permissions affect such capabilities as the reference's right to 
		view (or modify) the value it points to,
		create multiple copies of that reference, 
		and use locks or atomics for synchronizing access to the reference's value.</p>
	<p>The primary purpose of permissions is to improve program safety by preventing data races,
		where multiple concurrent threads step on each other when trying to access the same value.
		Each permission uses a different strategy to make it impossible for multiple
		threads to perform lifetime-overlapping atomic transactions on the same value.</p>
	<p>Prudent use of permissions can also help make code easier to understand and improve execution performance.</p>
	<p>There are two kinds of permissions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Static.</b> The safety guarantees for static permissions are enforced entirely by the compiler.
		This means there is no runtime overhead to use static permissions.
		Static permissions facilitate permission transitions, as described later.</li>
		<li><b>Lock.</b>
		The safety guarantees for locked permissions are enforced by a combination of compiler and runtime (lock) mechanisms.
		To access the value pointed at by a locked reference, one must first acquire the lock.
		This is done by borrowing a reference. Only region-managed references can specify a lock permission.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This page focuses only on static permissions.
	<a href="refpermlock.html">Lock permissions</a> are discussed later.</p>

	<h2>List of Permissions</h2>
	<p>There are only five static permissions:</p>
	
	<dl>
	<dt id="uni">uni</dt>
	<dd>The <span class="pre">uni</span> (unique) permission is quite versatile.
		It may be used to view or mutate the value it points to.
		It may hop safely from thread to thread without any runtime penalty,
		making it the fastest way to move mutable data from one thread to another.</p>
	<p>The name, "unique", signals its one restriction:
		there can only be <i>one</i> active reference to its value at a time.
		Because of this, its use is governed by	<a href="refmove.html">move semantics</a>.
		The reference may be moved to another variable, function, or thread,
		but doing so makes it inaccessible at its former home.</p>
	<p><span class="pre">uni</span> is ideal when we start off only needing one reference to a value 
		(or isolated graph). It allows us to safely move a value's reference around between scopes and threads.
		Later we can transition it to shared mutable or immutable.
		Performance optimization benefits
		may also result from knowing the reference is unique.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt>imm</dt>
	<dd>The <span class="pre">imm</span> (immutable) permission 
		declares that a reference's value will never change.
		Multiple references may point to the same immutable value,
		even across multiple threads.
		An <span class="pre">imm</span> reference may view its value,
		but not alter it.</p></dd>

	<dt>mut</dt>
	<dd>The <span class="pre">mut</span> (mutable) permission
		allows multiple references to freely access or change the same value at any time.
		However, all references to the same value are restricted to a single thread.</p>
	<p>A <span class="pre">mut</span> array reference may not re-size its array.
		Similarly, a <span class="pre">mut</span> reference may not alter a variant value.</p></dd>

	<dt id="ro">ro</dd>
	<dd>A <span class="pre">ro</span> (readonly) reference may read, but not modify, the value it points to.
		This may sound like <span class="pre">imm</span>, but it is not the same.
		<span class="pre">imm</span> guarantees that <i>no</i> other mutable reference to the same object exists,
		making it safe to share between threads. 
		<span class="pre">ro</span> makes no such guarantee.
		Therefore, <span class="pre">ro</span> references cannot be safely shared with another thread.</p>
	<p>The primary use for <span class="pre">ro</span> rests in how it 
		allows a function to take in a reference of 
		<a href="#toro">nearly any permission</a>,
		simply by promising not to change the value the reference points at.
		This polymorphic flexibility is why a borrowed reference's default permission
		is <span class="pre">ro</span>, if no permission is explicitly specified.</p></dd>
	
	<dt>opaq</dt>
	<dd>An <span class="pre">opaq</span> (opaque) reference
	may never be used to read or modify the value it points to.
	This restriction is useful for references to functions or
	<a href="refstruct.html#opaque">opaque</a> values,
	where it makes no sense to access the value they point to.</p></dd>
	</dl>

	<h2>Variable vs. Reference Permissions</h2>
	<p>Initially, it may feel confusing,  distinguishing the role of
		a permission on a reference vs. on a <a href="refterm.html#varperm">variable</a>,
		particularly if the variable holds a reference.
		Quite simply, a <b>variable</b>'s permission governs whether you can give
		the variable a new value.
		A <b>reference</b>'s permission governs what you can do with the reference.
		These are separable concerns.</p>
	<p>To illustrate this, consider these variations:</p>
<pre>
imm ref1 = &amp;imm x
imm ref2 = &amp;mut x
mut ref3 = &amp;imm x
mut ref4 = &amp;mut x
</pre>
	<p>Because of the <span class="pre">mut</span> variable permission,
	<span class="pre">ref3</span> and <span class="pre">ref4</span>
	may be changed to hold a different reference.
	<span class="pre">ref1</span> and <span class="pre">ref2</span> cannot.
</p>
<pre>
ref1 = &amp;imm x   // ** ILLEGAL! the ref1 variable cannot be changed **
ref2 = &amp;mut x   // ** ILLEGAL! the ref2 variable cannot be changed **
ref3 = &amp;imm x   // ok
ref4 = &amp;mut x   // ok
</pre>
	<p>In contrast, because of the <span class="pre">mut</span> reference permission,
	the references in <span class="pre">ref2</span> and <span class="pre">ref4</span>
	may be changed to point to a different value.
	The values pointed to by <span class="pre">ref1</span> and <span class="pre">ref3</span> cannot be altered.
</p>
<pre>
*ref1 = 5   // ** ILLEGAL! The value pointed at by ref1 cannot be changed **
*ref2 = 5   // ok
*ref3 = 5   // ** ILLEGAL! The value pointed at by ref3 cannot be changed **
*ref4 = 5   // ok
</pre>

<h2>Permission Transitions</h2>
	<p>A new copy of a reference typically has the same permission as the
		original reference, which is often necessary to preserve the reference's safety guarantees.
		In certain cases, however, we may safely create a
		reference copy carrying a different permission.</p>

	<h3 id="toro">To 'ro'</h3>
	<p>It is safe to borrow a <span class="pre">ro</span>
		reference from a reference of any permission other than <span class="pre">opaq</span>.
		This quality is what makes it attractive for functions to polymorphically
		accept <span class="pre">ro</span> references to any values
		they do not intend to modify.</p>

	<h3>From 'uni'</h3>
	<p>At some point in the lifetime of a <span class="pre">uni</span> reference's value, 
		one may need to transition to allowing multiple, shared references to that value.
		On a temporary basis (for some lexical lifetime), this transition may be accomplished
		by using <a href="refborref.html#permtrans">borrowed references</a>.</p>
	<p>Using borrowed references <i>does</i> make it possible to temporarily transition
		a <span class="pre">uni</span> reference to some shared reference permission. 
		During the lifetime of a borrowed reference, the source for the borrowed reference may not be used.
		However, once the lifetime of the borrowed reference expires,
		the original source becomes usable again:</p>
<pre>
imm uniref = +rc 5
{
  imm bref1 &amp;mut i32 = uniref   // Coerce owning reference to a 'mut' borrowed reference
  imm bref2 = ref2              // Share with another borrowed reference
  *bref2 = *bref1 + 1
  *uniref = 6                   // Error, uniref is unusable during scope of borrowed 'bref1'
}
*uniref = 7                     // Allowed, since borrowed references have expired
</pre>

	<p>It is also possible to permanently transition a
		<span class="pre">uni</span> reference to references holding shared permissions,
		such as <span class="pre">mut</span> or <span class="pre">imm</span>.
		This is accomplished by moving the `uni` reference value to
		a reference that holds a shared permission.
		The original <span class="pre">uni</span> reference is consumed (because of move semantics),
		leaving us with a new sharable reference, from which copies can be made.</p>		
<pre>
imm ref = +rc 5                 // Allocate new value, return 'uni' reference
imm newref1 &amp;mut i32 = ref      // Move reference to newref with 'mut' permission
imm newref2 &amp;mut i32 = newref1  // Two 'mut' references to the same object
*newref2 = *newref1             // Either reference may be used (but not ref any longer)
</pre>
	<p>The transition of an region-managed reference
		from <span class="pre">uni</span> to a shared permission reference is normally a one way trip.
		Once this transition has happened,
		you cannot safely transition a <span class="pre">mut</span> reference back to a
		<span class="pre">uni</span> reference (or even to an <span class="pre">imm</span> reference).
		The reference is now "frozen" to the restrictions of its new permission:
		As <span class="pre">mut</span>, it can never be shared across threads.
		As <span class="pre">imm</span>, it can never be altered.</p>
		
	<h2>Permission Recovery</h3>
	<p>Permission transitions are not actually always a one-way trip. Under certain circumstances,
	it is possible to safely recover "lost" permissions.
	
	<ul>
	<li><b>Borrowed reference recovery.</b>
		Borrowing a reference temporarily transitions to a new permission. 
		When the borrowed reference expires, the original permission on the source reference is restored.
		So, a <span class="pre">uni</span> can be borrowed as <span class="pre">mut</span> or <span class="pre">imm</span>.
		When the borrowed references expire, you once again again have the original <span class="pre">uni</span> reference.
		Similarly, one can borrow as <span class="pre">ro</span> and get back the original reference's permission later.</li>
	<li><b>Pure method calls</b>
		Sometimes it is polymorphically convenient to be able to call a method on an object where we have
		a <span class="pre">uni</span> reference, and we don't want the calling function to lose the object to the
		called method due to move semantics and we don't want to borrow.
		This is possible to do if the called method is pure, and no other arguments to the method call
		have <span class="pre">mut</span> or <span class="pre">ro</span> references.</li>
	<li><b>Recovery blocks</b>
		With this feature, described below, it is possible to unwind a some permission transition that happens inside
		the block for any value returned by the block.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 id="recover">Recover Blocks</h3>
	<p>The <span class="pre">recover</span> block is a helpful way to transition a permission backwards.
		Any mutable permission can be recovered as any permission.
		Similarly, any readonly permission can be recovered as any read-only permission or opaque.
		This is useful for many situations:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Create some shared, mutable object inside the block and receive it back as a <span class="pre">uni</span> reference.</li>
	<li>Create a cyclic immutable data structure. Inside the block, create a shared, mutable data structure
		and then recover it as <span class="pre">imm</span>.</li>
	<li>Temporarily transition <span class="pre">uni</span> to <span class="pre">mut</span>, 
		perform complex mutable operations on it and return it as <span class="pre">uni</span> again.</li>
	<li>Extract a mutable field from a <span class="pre">uni</span> and return it as an <span class="pre">uni</span>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This example demonstrates the third scenario:</p>
<pre>
recover:
  imm ref1 = uniref as &amp;mut i32
  imm ref2 = ref1
  *ref1 = 5
  ref2 as &amp;uni i32
</pre>
	<p>The recover block imposes several restrictions in order to ensure the reverse transition is safe:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>You have no access to any <span class="pre">mut</span>, <span class="pre">ro</span> or lock permission
		reference/object outside the recover block, whether local or global.</li>
	<li>Any functions you call must be pure.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These restrictions exist to stop unsafe references from leaking out of the
		<span class="pre">recover</span> block. Given that created reference aliases expire within the block,
		we know any returned reference is unique.</p> 

	<h2>When struct fields are references</h2>
	<p>There is a symbiotic, two-way relationship between the attributes of a composite type (like a struct)
	and the permissions on its field references:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Permissions are infectious.</b> 
	When struct fields are references, the permissions of those references can infect the
	properties of the struct type.</li>
	<li><b>Viewpoint adaptation.</b>
	Conversely, the permissions on some reference to the composite type can restrict
	the permissions we effectively get on any field's reference.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Let's go into detail on both these phenomena.</p>
	
	<h3>Permissions are infectious</h3>
	<p>Let's say we define a new struct type with fields that are references:</p>
<pre>
struct Car:
  engine &amp;uni Engine
  owner &amp;mut Person
</pre>
	<p>Since the engine field is a <span class="pre">uni</span> reference,
		move semantics apply not only to the engine field, but also to any value of type Car!
		If any part of a type has move semantics, the whole type does as well.</p>
	<p>Similarly, since the owner field is a <span class="pre">mut</span> reference,
		that permission forbids the reference from being shared across multiple threads.
		If the field must remain thread-local, so must any Car value (or reference to a Car value).
		This principle applies to all the thread-local permissions:
		<span class="pre">mut</span>, <span class="pre">ro</span>
		and <span class="pre">rwcell</span>.</p>

	<h3 id="view">Viewpoint Adaptation</h3>
	<p>Using the example above, let's imagine we have a borrowed reference to a Car:</p>
<pre>
fn handleCar(car &amp;Car):
  if car.owner.age &lt; 18:
    car.owner.age = 18         // illegal mutation
</pre>
	<p>Even though the car owner field is mutable, the reference we have to car is not.
		If we don't have permission to mutate Car, we also can't use the car reference to 
		mutate any object that Car points at.</p>
	<p>This is called viewpoint adaptation: the permissions we get are the intersection
		of all permissions we need to go through to get to the object we want.
		To read the value, all references must grant permission to read.
		To mutate the value, all reference must grant permission to mutate.</p>
	<p>Sadly, this also mean that our car reference cannot see anything about the engine.
		A shared reference cannot see through a <span class="pre">uni</span> reference,
		because that would effectively be sharing what is supposed to be a unique reference.</p>
	<p>We can only see engine if our car reference is also <span class="pre">uni</span>.
		But if we do that, then we can no longer see anything about the owner because it is shared, mutable.
		It would violate the guarantee of <span class="pre">uni</span> to move this reference
		to another thread, if this could result in <span class="pre">mut</span> references to the
		same Person sprinkled across several threads.</p>
		
	<h3>Externally-isolated graphs</h3>
	<p>Wouldn't it be nice if we could somehow guarantee that when we moved car from one thread
		to another, that all mutable references to owner would travel with it?
		If we could guarantee this, it would be safe to perform the move.</p>
	<p>In effect, what we want to be able to do is have a graph of multiple objects that is
		externally isolated, so that we could draw a boundary line around the graph of nodes
		and there is only pointer into that graph that originates outside that graph.
		This would be the owning <span class="pre">uni</span> reference to the graph's root node.
		Within the graph could be multiple references to the same node, but none of them
		originate from outside the boundary line.</p>
	<p>To accomplish this, and have visibility into shared references inside the graph,
		use the <span class="pre">recover</span> block as described above.
		Transition the original <span class="pre">uni</span> reference to <span class="pre">mut</span>
		inside the block. Now, we can see and mutate all shared, mutable nodes, 
		including reading or extracting values from them. When done, the block
		can safely return the original reference as <span class="pre">uni</span>.</p>
