	<p>Before talking about Cone's distinctive type features, 
		it would be prudent to offer a worldwind tour that shows how much of Cone's type system is deliberately familiar.
		For example, Cone's concrete types are largely derived from C and ML dialects:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Integer (i32, u8) and float (f32) primitive number types, as well as <a href="coneref/refnumber.html#enum">enums</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="coneref/refstruct.html">struct</a> record types, with named fields.</li>
	<li>tuples, with comma-separated values or types.</li>
	<li><a href="coneref/refarray.html">array</a> types, both fixed-size and dynamically-sized.</li>
	<li><a href="coneref/refunion.html">union</a> (sum) types</li>
	<li><a href="coneref/reffunc.html">function</a> signatures</li>
	<li><a href="coneref/refvoid.html">void</a> (unit) type</li>
	</ul>
	<p><a href="refgeneric.html">Generic</a> versions of any type can be defined, using type-constrained parameters.</p >
	<p>Inspired by OOP languages, all named (nominal) types support <a href="coneref/refmethod.html">methods</a>. 
		Many operators are implicitly implemented as methods. Methods may be overloaded.</p>
	<p>Like Rust, Cone supports several useful (and infectious) type constraints:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="coneref/refmove.html">Move semantics</a>, disallowing multiple copies of a value</li>
	<li><a href="coneref/reflifefn.html">Lifetimes</a>, preventing a value from escaping beyond its block scope</li>
	<li>Thread-bound, preventing a value from escaping its current thread</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Type safety is enforced strictly. With the notable exception of subtype substitution, values must stay in their
		type lanes. Even better, nullability is not the default: one must explicitly type a value as nullable using
		<a href="coneref/refoption.html">Option[T]</a> or '?'.
		Similarly, one cannot throw an exception up the call stack. Instead, failures are returned using 
		<a href="coneref/refresult.html">Result</a> type values.</p>
	<p>To reduce the burden on the programmer, the Cone compiler supports bi-directional type inference.
		This minimizes how often type information needs to be annotated in the program.</p>
	<p>In summary, Cone's rich static types improve long-term development productivity, as they help you catch more errors sooner.
		These static types also make it possible to build faster programs, because you can design data structures
		that can be optimized for what runs quickly on modern CPUs.</p>
	
	<h2>Cone's Distinctive Type System Features</h2>
	<p>Even though Cone's type system is mostly derivative (although delightfully re-mixed), 
		several type features are either new or significantly enriched in Cone.
		These improvements improve your productivity, by making it easier to 
		express common and useful design patterns in your code, particularly adding dynamic type-like flexibility,
		without losing the performance and safety guarantees of static types:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="memory.html">Region-managed references</a>, providing greater control over how memory is used.</li>
	<li><a href="coneref/refperm.html">Permissions</a>, enabling faster static race safety protections.</li>
	<li><a href="#traits">Traits</a>, supporting more flexible polymorphism</li>
	<li><a href="#variant">Variant types</a>, enriching how variant types are implemented in memory.</li>
	<li><a href="#subtype">Robust Subtyping</a>, enabling safe substitutions of subtypes into supertypes.</li>
	<li><a href="#inherit">Delegated inheritance</a>, offering a better way to facilitate method reuse.</li>
	<li><a href="#extend">Method extensions</a>, making it easy to add methods to an existing type.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Let's walk through each of these in turn.</p>
	
	<h3 id="traits">Traits</h3>
	<p>Many languages support some form of existential polymorphism, calling the feature
		traits, interfaces, abstract classes, typeclasses, concepts, protocols, etc.
		In general terms, this feature is used to define an abstract pattern of function or method signatures 
		that multiple types can conform to, for substitution purposes.</p>
	<p>Cone calls these traits. Cone's traits carry some distinctive improvements:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Structural (vs. nominal) compliance</b>. This means that a struct does not need to declare that it
		extends (or implements) a trait, in order for the trait to later be applied to the struct.
		The struct need only comply with the trait's interface.
		<p>This is a huge productivity benefit for you, because you don't have to defensively build a whole bunch of
		interface classes for all your types, just in case you might need them later.
		It also means you can retroactively apply a trait to some existing packaged library type,
		without needing to get the packaged type changed.</p></li>
	<li><b>Field (row) polymorphism</b>. This means that a trait can define fields as well as method signatures.
		When it does, complying structs must have those fields. It is then possible to use the trait
		to directly access these fields, without having to waste CPU cycles on going through a getter/setter method.</li>
	<li><b>Multi-role versatility</b>. A single Cone trait can facilitate three very different, but related roles:
		<ol>
		<li>A type constraint for a generic's type parameter, ensuring only valid types are statically substituted.</li>
		<li>A runtime mediator for virtual method dispatch or field access mechanisms.</li>
		<li>A base type used to create multiple, compliant variant types (see below).</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="variant">Variant Types</h3>
	<p>Often we want type flexibility, such that some value can (at runtime) be one of several possible types.
		Most languages offer only one way to accomplish this, either with sum types or using inheritance.
		Cone supports three different flavors of variant types, each with different advantages and constraints:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b><a href="coneref/refunion.html">Union types</a></b>
		support a fixed number of variants. All variants are padded to be the same size. 
		Cone's union types offer several useful capabilities not supported by traditional sum types:</p>
			<ul>
		<li>Union types support the specification (and use) of methods for each variant.</li>
		<li>All variants of a union type may share a common set of shared fields or methods.</li>
		<li>Virtual method dispatch is supported when the union defines method signatures and 
			all variants implement those methods.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><b><a href="coneref/refvariant.html">Closed trait-based variants</a></b>
		also support a fixed number of variants, but each variant can vary in size.</li>
	<li><b><a href="coneref/refvariant.html">Open trait-based variants</a></b>.
		Any number of variants types may be defined across multiple modules, each with its own size.
		This corresponds pretty closely with variant types that some languages support via inheritance.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>All flavors of variant types support methods, shared fields, virtual dispatch and pattern matching.</p>
	<p>In most cases, union types are the preferable choice for speed and support for the largest variety of design patterns,
		so long as its okay that the number of variants can all be defined in one module and all be padded to the same size.
		However, when these restrictions are not acceptable, it is nice to be able to make use of trait-based variants.</p>
	
	<h3 id="inherit">Robust Subtyping</h3>
	<p>Relevant to our conversation about traits and variant types, is how extensively and safely subtyping
		is supported by Cone. Subtyping reflects the idea that a value of some type may be safely substituted
		into the corresponding value of its supertype. Variant types are subtypes of their union or base trait.
		Region-managed references are subtypes of borrowed reference. Some permissions are subtypes of other permissions.
		And so on.</p>
	<p>Subtyping is an important component for supporting polymorphic, flexible types, in that it ensures
		that safety is not compromised.
		Cone's subtyping rules are sophisticated enough to correctly handle variance requirements in the presence
		of references, mutation and function signatures.</p>
	<p>Subtype substitution can happen at compile-time (via parametric types on generics) 
		or at runtime (via automatic runtime coercion). The rules for runtime substitution are less flexible
		due to to memory constraints.</p>
	<p>Runtime subtyping is particularly valuable for:
	<ul>
	<li>References.
		If separate logic were needed for every combination of permissions and regions, code could get quite verbose!
		Better yet, use of implicit reference coercions is "free": 
		it neither bloats the size of generated code nor carries a runtime performance penalty.</li>
	<li>Functions or methods.
		Instead of needing a distinct function for every combination of types,
		a single function can be written able to serve the needs of diversely-typed values.</p>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 id="inherit">Delegated Inheritance</h3>
	<p>In some circles, inheritance has gotten a bad name for being problematic and unnecessary.
		Who doesn't flinch at large, complex programs that become hard to maintain due to deep inheritance trees
		and fragile base classes?</p>
	<p>When you have a powerful independent mechanism for polymorphism in traits, the need for 
		implementation inheritance is definitely reduced.
		That said, there still are times when it is handy for one type to be able to reuse methods
		implemented by another type that is part of its composition.</p>
	<p>Cone offers a distinctive form of inheritance called 
		<a href="coneref/refinherit.html">"delegated inheritance"</a> which satisfies this need.
		Consider this example:</p>
<pre>
struct Engine
  fuel   f32
  torque f32

  fn thrust(amt f32) { ... }
  fn power(on Bool) { ... }

struct Car:
  engine Engine use fuel, thrust
  body   SportyLook
  wheels RimWheels
</pre>
	<p>As part of its composition, Car has an Engine. 
		The engine field specifies "use" to request delegated inheritance for the Engine's fuel field and thrust method. 
		This means that <span class="pre">car.thrust(2.3)</span> is legal, and will
		be forwarded automatically to Engine's thrust method like this:
		<span class="pre">car.engine.thrust(2.3)</span>. It is nice to be able to do this without
		requiring all the ceremony of building various delegation methods on Car,
		as recommended by the "Favor Composition Over Inheritance" gang of four.</p>
	<p>By using delegated inheritance, you can exploit the expressiveness of method and field reuse between types, 
		while avoiding the entangling complexity of traditional inheritance.</p>
		
	<h3 id="extend">Method Extensions</h3>
	<p>Sometimes, we import types from a package, but wish it supported more capabilities (methods) than it does.
		Cone's <a href="coneref/reftypealias.html">"extend"</a> feature makes
		it possible for one module to extend the methods supported by an imported type.
		This would make it possible to import an floating-point number type that only supports arithmetic operations, 
		and then extend it to also support logarithmic or trigonometric operations.
		In effect, Cone's "extend" feature provides a workable solution to the so-called expression problem.</p>
